# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem


For each of the commands `cd`,`ls`, and `cat`, and using the workspace you created in this lab we are doing the following:

* Share an example of using the command with no arguments.

* Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.

* Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

## cd

1) An example of using the `cd` command without any arguemnts would look be as followed
   ![Image](cd1.png)

In this, we see that when we run the `cd` command in the working directory `home`, the following output does not produce anything. It is simply the action of us changing the directory. `cd` without arguemnts will just return us to the home directory

3) An example of using the command with a path a directory as as arguement would show the following
   ![Image](cd2.png)

We see again, there is no output. However we can notice, when we use the command with a a path to the directory to the terminal, in this case lecture 1, the new line to write a new command displays `user@sahara ~/lecture1]$` meaning that we are now working out of the directory of lecture 1
